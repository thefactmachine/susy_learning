#Notes 
run "compass watch" to monitor and then compile. 

SASS has two dialects.  They are just different syntaxes.

The scss is compiled into css.

Every project begins with a $susy map which is just a key value structure. 

```
global-box-sizing: border-box  
```
The above command makes sure that the boxe's size will be set to the outside of their border.

Remember that the box model goes from: content to padding to border to margin.

## Example of Susy Header

```
@import "normalize";
@import "susy";

$susy:(
  
  // this sets the context ...this means instead of
  // writing "span 2 of 4" we write "span(2)"
  
  columns: 4, 

  // basically this sets the maximimum width. 
  // automatically adjusts when using a Retina display.
  
  container: 1140px,
  
  // display the debug grid...
  
  debug: (image: show), 
  
  // set the border-box so the size is defined as outside the border
  
  global-box-sizing: border-box
  );
  
```

## Grid container
Every grid requires a grid container.  This is the div element with class wrap as shown below:

```html
<div class="wrap">
	<main class="content"><h2>Content</h2></main>
	<aside class="sidebar"><h2>Sidebar</h2></aside>
</div>
```

Then this is refferred to in the scss as:

```
.wrap {
  @include container();
  height: 100vh;
}
```

If the website is to be resposive, the container needs a 
max-width property instead of a width property.  Including the container as shown **above**, generates the following CSS:

```
.wrap {max-width: 1140px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;}
```

Setting the margins to "auto" will effectively centre the content.



If we want the maximum width of the container to be 1140px, we can tell Susy to create this container by adding the container key to the $susy map.

## Last property
This just tells Susy that column was the final column and that means **do not** put a gutter to the right of the column.

## Context
$context is the argument that follows the **of** keyword.  In the following the context is 12.

```
@include span(3 of 4);
```
Context is also the number of columns in the parent element. 

### Rewriting our scss using parent context
Because the susy map is defined as:

```
$susy:(
  columns: 4, 
  container: 1140px,
  debug: (image: show), 
  global-box-sizing: border-box
  );
```

The context is 4 for the content and sidebar elements
So, we **had** our content and side bar defined as:

```
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4);
}

.sidebar {
  @include span(1 of 4 last);
}
```
But we can rewrite these as:

```
.content {
  @include span(3);
}

.sidebar {
  @include span(1 last);
}
```

## Nested layouts
We currently have a 4 column layout.  There are gutters after each of the first 3 columns.  We are going to define a column inside the first column.

Here is the HTML:

```
<div class="content">
<div class="inner-content">Nested Item</div>
</div>
```

Here we define the scss
```
.inner-content {
  @include span(1);
}
```
